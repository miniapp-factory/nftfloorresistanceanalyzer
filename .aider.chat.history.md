App Name: NFT Floor Resistance Analyzer**

Description:
NFT Floor Resistance Analyzer is a Mini App that analyzes the buy and sell pressure around an NFT collection’s floor price. It identifies how many listings exist at key price levels, detects “walls” of sellers, and highlights zones of strong resistance or support. This helps users evaluate how easily a floor can rise or fall based on current market depth.

Key Features:
 • Real-time analysis of floor price resistance and support levels
 • Detection of large listing clusters (“seller walls”)
 • Monitoring floor depth across multiple marketplaces
 • Historical data showing changes in resistance zones
 • Dashboard to compare resistance profiles of multiple collections

Use Case:
Perfect for NFT traders and collectors who want to understand price structure, anticipate floor breakouts, and identify opportunities based on market depth dynamics.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
